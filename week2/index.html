      <p>Every champion has their own special abilities and powers with unique look and playstyles.
      They have an assigned class, with a limited number also possessing a secondary class. These classes are representing a defined set of patterns in player's behavior, responses, and reactions to environment.
      This may also include preferred item and ability paths, summoner spells, stats, or runes. Below are available classes:</p>
      <ul class="dot">
        <li>Assassins</li>
        <li>Marksmans</li>
        <li>Fighters</li>
        <li>Mages</li>
        <li>Supports</li>
